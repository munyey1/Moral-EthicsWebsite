			<ul>
				<li>We generate around 40 million tons of electronic waste every year, worldwide. That’s like throwing
				800 laptops every second.</li>
				<li>E-waste comprises 70% of our overall toxic waste.</li>
				<li>An average cellphone user replaces their unit once every 18 months.</li>
				<li>Only 12.5% of E-Waste is recycled.</li>
				<li>85% of our E-Waste are sent to landfills and incinerators are mostly burned, and release harmful 
				toxins in the air!</li>
				<li>80% of E-Waste in the US and most of other countries are transported to Asia.</li>
				<li>300 million computers and 1 billion cellphones go into production annually. 
				It is expected to grow by 8% per year.</li>
				<li>E-waste contains hundreds of substances, of which many are toxic. This includes mercury, lead,
				arsenic, cadmium, selenium, chromium, and flame retardants.</li>

		<h1>What is E-Waste</h1>
			<p>
			Electronic waste or e-waste, is a popular, informal name for electronic products nearing the end of their "useful life"
			in which they are discarded. Used electronics that are refurbished, reused or recycled are also classed as e-waste. 
			Electronic scrap components such as CPUs, contain harzardous materials such as lead, beryillium, or cadmium and are
			potentially harmful to humans. 
			</p>
		<h1>Is E-waste Bad?</h1>
			<p>Many of our E-Waste end up in Asia or Africa landfills. The recycling method in these landfills is not exactly 
			the “recycling” that we have in mind. E-Waste is bad, for everyone, for our planet and most especially for the 
			workers on the landfills. They are the ones that are hugely exposed to the toxicity from the e-waste, and are 
			greatly at risk.
			</p>
			<p>
			E-Wastes are buried or incinerated in landfills where their toxins pollute our land, air and water. Most of the time, 
			they are sent to developing countries where workers extract the precious metals from the discarded electronics.
			</p>
			<p>
			Workers on E-Waste sites are paid an average of $1.50 per day. They are unprotected while working with the toxic 
			substances on the site. They are the first to inhale the toxins that are released in the air when electronic parts 
			are burned. Many of these workers are children!
			</p>
		<h1>Why we should recycle Electronics</h1>
			<p>Cellphones and other electronic devices contain precious metals like gold and silver. The US alone throws away 
			cellphones with $60 million worth of gold/silver yearly.
			</p>
			<p>
			Recycling 1 million laptops saves energy equivalent to the energy used by 3600 homes in the US annually.
			<br><br>
			Most of the components of E-Waste are electronic equipments that can be re-used and recycled for materials recovery.

		<h1>What can we do about our personal E-Waste?</h1>
			<p>There are several options when it comes to the proper disposal of your electronic devices.
			</p>
			<p>Your old cellphone can still be used by another person. Same with your old computer or television. Donate it to friends, 
			charities or community outreach programs - even to a stranger! This is better than the hazardous e-waste materials ending 
			up in a landfill somewhere.
			</p>
			Find a Certified E-Waste Recycler. Those who are not certified will just send it off somewhere else where it can do its damage.
			<p>
			Here is a video about what to do when recycling electronics.
