					<li>The information held must be adequate, relevant and not excessive when compared with the purpose stated in the register.
					So you must have enough detail but not too much for the job that you are doing with the data.</li>
					<li>It must be accurate and be kept up to date. There is a duty to keep it up to date, for example to change an address when
					people move.</li>
					<li>It must not be kept longer than is necessary for the registered purpose. It is alright to keep information for certain
					lengths of time but not indefinitely. This rule means that it would be wrong to keep information about past customers longer 
					than a few years at most.</li>
					<li>The information must be kept safe and secure. This includes keeping the information backed up and away from any unauthorised 
					access. It would be wrong to leave personal data open to be viewed by just anyone.</li>

		<h1>Computers in the Workforce</h1>
			<p>
			Computer technology is now a norm in the work place, and with everyday passing by at the office, workers are now 
			represented with the risk of having illicit material on their screens as they work. Furthermore, the security of workers
			data should be protected as companies must follow the data protection act 1998.

		<h2 style='padding-top:3%;'>Automation and Robotics</h2>
			<p>Automation in the workforce is a big area in workplaces and has replaced many jobs. For example, car production.
			Due to this, many jobs are at risk, as automation is growing and is likely to replace many jobs. Although this is a problem, 
			automation heavily helps with time and is eventually cost effective. Despite this, there is fear that in the future all 
			possible jobs will be replaced by robotics and that leaves us worried about the advancement of robotics and automation.</p>
		<h2 style='padding-top:3%;'>Privacy, safety and data security</h2>
			<p>Companies have a legal and moral obligation to protect sensitive corporate data. This may be customer or staff records, 
			contracts, and sensitive commercial-in-confidence information.
			Where computer use is tracked by the business, employees should be made aware and clearly advised on what is and isnâ€™t considered 
			ethical use of the systems.</p>

		<h2>The Importance of Computers in the Workplace</h2>
			<p>Computers can improve communication both within the workplace and when dealing with customers. An e-mail can convey a large
			amount of information at one time and can be viewed at the convenience of the recipient. Computers also give customers an 
			additional method of making inquiries or receiving information.
			</p>
			<p>Computers can increase the speed and accuracy of many work processes, which improves overall worker efficiency. Documents 
			can be written and edited much more quickly with the aid of a word processing program, and procedures, such as billing and 
			accounting, can also occur more rapidly and with fewer errors. 
			</p>
			<p>As workplaces depend more heavily on computers, the need for paper may also increase. Reducing paper may lead to a 
			reduction in office supply costs and open more work space that had previously been used to store paper documents in file 
			cabinets. 
			</p>
			<p>However, the possibility of jobs being replaced by robots and ai is looming over us as a chance in the future. This is a 
			huge fear as it could lead to many humans unemployed.
			<br>Here is a video about this possibility.
