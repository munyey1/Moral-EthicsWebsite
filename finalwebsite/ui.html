			<h2>Colour Paradigms</h2>
				<p>
				The colour red has many meanings, in the western hemisphere red could symbol hotness, love, 
				anger, war, hatred, devil, cupid, passion, violence and many more. However, in China red 
				symbolises luck and prosperity, which is a complete opposite to some meanings elsewhere. 
				</p>
				<p>Here are some other examples:
				<ul>
					<li><b>Yellow</b>: Bright, happy, energising and warm, yellow can also mean cowardice and 
					dishonesty. In some countries, people tie yellow ribbons around trees as a symbol of 
					hope for missing loved ones. Yellow in Egypt is a colour associated with mourning, in 
					Japan it represents courage whilst in India, it is the colour associated with trade. In 
					Islam, it is associated with wisdom. </li>
					<li><b>Black and White</b>:  Black can be associated with power but it is also associated 
					with death, evil, the occult and mystery. In western cultures, black is the predominant 
					colour used for mourning but in others, it is associated with rebellion. Black in Japan 
					can symbolise experience where white symbolises naivety. White in western cultures is 
					associated with health, cleanliness, virtue and purity and is worn by brides, although 
					it is a mourning colour in China and some other Asian cultures. Angels are often painted 
					in white tones.</li>
					<li><b>Purple</b>: Dark shades of purple are often associated with royalty whereas 
					lighter shades are more romantic. However, go to Thailand and purple is used as a mourning
					colour.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>From these examples mentioned you could probably guess that there is a plethora of more 
				colours representing different things in different countries. Therefore, we must be careful 
				that some societies and cultures interpret different colours than other cultures, and we must 
				take that into consideration whenever designing websites.
				</p>
				<p>Here is a video going in depth on this topic of colour paradigms.

		<h1>Layout, Colour Paradigms and Impact of Character Sets</h1>
			<p>
			In the past years, web development has taken some drastic turns recently with the rise of material 
			and responsive design and new web technologies. There have been pushes to ensure that the 
			layout of websites are intuitive for new users and to ensure that they are easy to use. 
			Additionally, there have been pushes to ensure that websites are adaptive to people with various 
			visual impairments or difficulties in viewing some colours such as colour blindness and muted colour 
			pallets. However, there are other impacts of colour within our cultures that are sometimes 
			overlooked which is the pyschology with colours that can bias our views towards a site in some 
			way. Basic examples include red being related to a warning or love, green to nature and blue to 
			sorrow or water. However, these only apply to more western cultures. With the wide audience that
			a website can reach, there may need to be a consideration for the impact of colours between 
			cultures as the meanings behind them can change as you move between countries and cultures.
			</p>
		<h2 style='padding-top:1%;'>Layout</h2>
			<p>It is often heard that people in western cultures being advising to keep designs simple, or 'clean'
			when designing websites or applications that give information of some description. 
			Chinese, Korean and Japanese users, for example, tend to find these kinds of sites a little 
			bland, dull and unappealing. Many of the most popular sites in these countries are packed 
			full of information, banners, tables, leaving no wasted space available on the screen.
			</p>
			<p>Some languages like German, for example can cause problems for some designers because 
			German uses 30% more space to say something in writing than writing text in English, 
			whilst Japanese and Chinese require much less space. How much space is needed for pages, 
			especially how they might look after a translation process, is another design consideration 
			for designers of global digital products.
			</p>
			<p>Images have to be decided wisely in the layout of any digital product. Images of a woman 
			in a bikini may not be acceptable in some conservative Arabic countries. The Swastika is a 
			sacred symbol in Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism but is also associated with Fascism and Nazi 
			Germany and is a banned symbol in some countries.
			</p>
		<h2 style='padding-top:1%'>Language and Character Sets</h2>
			<p>The way we look at a website depends on our culture. Arabic, Urdu and Hebrew speakers read 
			from right to left, the opposite way westerners read whilst Japanese readers can use text either 
			left to right or from up to down. Readers tend to scan the text and pictures on websites and 
			applications in the same way as they read.
			</p>
			<p>Many websites include support for Unicode, a set of codes for all the characters found in 
			over 90 different languages. UTF-8 is a form of character encoding that uses the Unicode set 
			of codes. By stating that UTF-8 is being used in any code a website designer or programmer
			is writing, translation programs can better do their job of translating sites and programs
			from one language to another. 
			</p>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>To conclude, the design of a user interface must be significantly considered as something as 
			little as a colour choice can be offensive to some certain people with a different society to 
			the intended target audience. To add to this, particular images should be examined before 
			implementing into a user interface design. Furthermore, the layout of a user interface should be 
			examined as there are many different ways to read text in multiple countries, from up to down, 
			left to right, or right to left. Layout design should be considered when making a global 
			website.
