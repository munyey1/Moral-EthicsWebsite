			<ul>
				<li>In China, more than 1 in 4 websites that are normally accessible through Google or other search 
				engines is blocked through a four level filtering process.</li>
				<li>The number of media websites that are blocked by the Chinese government: 923.</li>
				<li>1.72 billion. That’s the number of people that are affected by internet censorship on any given day.</li>
				<li>80% of the world doesn’t have access to an internet that is 100% uncensored.</li>
				<li>1% of internet users live in countries where criticism of the government and military are subject to 
				censorship.</li>
				<li>40% of the content that the Iranian government blocks are political or government websites. 
				Sometimes they even block their own websites.</li>
				<li>In Europe, the two most common forms of censorship are through the elimination of defamatory speech 
				and removal of content that is suspected to be a copyright violation.</li>
				<li>In France and Germany, Nazi propaganda is illegal and access to it is blocked. Sites that question 
				the existence of the Holocaust may also be blocked in Europe.</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>The Dark Web</h2>
			<p>In a remote and dangerous region of the internet dwells another lesser-known net, a lawless digital 
			no-man's-land with a shady reputation and an ominous name: The Dark Web.
			</p>
			<p>
            Here on the virtually anything-goes dark web, with its guaranteed anonymity, criminals and scammers of one 
			stripe or another, anti-government rebels, revolutionaries, terrorists and other varieties of outlaw can 
			hawk their goods and services, communicate with visitors and customers to their sites and with each other, 
			and operate anonymously and thus presumably with impunity.
			</p>
			<p>Major crimes committed through the assistance of the dark web include the sales of guns of every variety 
			and caliber, no license required, no questions asked. Buyers favor assault weapons such as the AK-47 
			assault rifle, but new and stolen handguns also sell briskly.
			</p>
			<p>It is clear that the dark web is a dangerous place and we must undertstand that if we ever access it,
			we are at risk of whatever happens. The dark web is the place of illegality and although many governments 
			understand this, the dark web is still running. This is a problem as many types of illegal action takes place 
			on the dark web, holding no morality of any kind.

		<h1>Internet Censorship</h1>
			<p>
			Censorship is the suppression or prohibition of any parts of books, films, news, etc. that are considered obscene, 
			politically unacceptable, or a threat to security. Therefore, by applying this to the internet, anything on the
			internet can be censored. The motivations for censorship range from well-intentioned desires to protect children 
			from unsuitable content to unauthorised access to certain content. No matter what the censors' reasons are, 
			the end result is the same, they block access to the web pages they identify as undesirable. However, not always 
			censoring content is correct. By restricting people to certain material on the internet doesn't allow them to 
			explore the internet, in terms of widening knowledge and understanding different views in the world.
			</p>
		<h2>Censorship at home</h2>
			<p>
			There's no denying the fact that the internet is a dangerous place to children and that the internet contains a plethora 
			of material that most parents wouldn't want their children to see. This can include, pornography, gambling sites, chat rooms,
			or hate speech, many that is unacceptable. Many parents worry about this and that is why censorship is so important to many 
			people. Parents or carers can resolve to restricting access to certain websites throught their ISP(Internet Service Provider)
			or by using web filters and monitering internet access.
			</p>
		<h2>International Censorship</h2>
			<p>
			Many countries restrict access to content on the Internet on some level. Even the United States has laws that impact the 
			kind of information you can access on the Internet in a school or public library. Some countries go much further than 
			that, and a few don't allow any access to the Internet at all.
			<br>
			The OpenNet Initiative (ONI), an organization dedicated to informing the public about Web filtering and surveillance 
			policies around the world, classifies web filtering into four categories:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Political:</b> Content that includes views contrary to the respective country's policies. The political category 
				also includes content related to human rights, religious movements and other social causes</li>
				<li><b>Social:</b> Web pages that focus on sexuality, gambling, drugs and other subjects that a nation might deem offensive</li>
				<li><b>Conflict/Security:</b> Pages that relate to wars, skirmishes, dissent and other conflicts</li>
				<li><b>Internet tools:</b> Web sites that offer tools like e-mail, instant messaging, language translation applications 
				and ways to circumvent censorship</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			The following countries have the strongest censorship:
			<ul>
				<li>Belarus</li>
				<li>China</li>
				<li>Cuba</li>
				<li>Egypt</li>
				<li>Iran</li>
				<li>Myanmar</li>
				<li>North Korea</li>
				<li>Saudi Arabia</li>
				<li>Syria</li>
				<li>Tunisia</li>
				<li>Turkmenistan</li>
				<li>Uzebkistan</li>
				<li>Vietnam</li>
			</ul>

		<h1>The Effects of Censorship</h1>
			<p>Although the thought of censorship seems great, there is a fact that it limits the knowledge and awareness
			of the world. For example, many people in the countries mentioned above are almost imprisoned and brainwashed
			with their countries beliefs.
			</p>
			<p>
			Here is a video about how censorship in China effect others.
