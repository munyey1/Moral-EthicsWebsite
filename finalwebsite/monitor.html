		<h1>Online Surveillance</h1>
			<p>
			Alongside censorship, online monitoring has become a very controversial topic in the recent years. This has raised 
			serious questions and discussions about how much information we want recorded about us and to what extent what 
			privacy we have online. Online surveillance poses a very different type of problem from the standard security camera on each corner 
			approach as the internet is usually considered a vast and accessible domain. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Despite this, monitoring behaviours isn't just about the internet. With technology evolving, there are many uses of 
			surveillance. For example:
			<ul>
				<li>Logging systems in public spaces. Eg. in a library, in a school.</li>
				<li>'Black boxes' installed into cars to improve the quality of driving for the trade of reduced prices.</li>
				<li>Electronic tagging on ankles of criminals on house arrest.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
		<h2>Monitoring in the Workplace</h2>
			<p>
			Computers in the workplace need to be monitored, as to what is present on the screens on computers. However, 
			recently there have been workplaces that request access to employees social media to review the content and to acknowledge 
			what the employee is like on social media before hiring them.
			</p>
			<p>Many believe that this is a violation of privacy, as work lives should be seperate from personal lives.

		<h1>The Effects of Monitoring Behaviour</h1>
			<p>With the rise in these surveillance and monitoring systems it has raised many questions as to the extent 
			that we should be monitored and to what freedoms we deserve in the technological age. Many would say that 
			surveillance should be dialed down for their privacy, however, many others regard it as a positive move 
			that allows us to protect citizens better and reduce the impact of digital crime.

			This is a specific video about how monitoring workers effects truck drivers. This video shows how it can 
			effect many people.
