			<h2>Some Examples of Automated Decision Making</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>A factory worker’s pay is linked to their productivity, which is monitored automatically. The decision about how much
					pay the worker receives for each shift they work is made automatically by referring to the data collected about their 
					productivity.
					<br><br>This is an example of solely automated decision making.</li>
					<br><li>An employee is issued with a warning about late attendance at work. The warning was issued because the employer’s 
					automated clocking-in system flagged the fact that the employee had been late on a defined number of occasions.</li>
					<li>An individual applies for a loan online. The website uses algorithms and automated credit searching to provide 
					an immediate yes/no decision on the application.</li>
				</ul>
				<br><h2>What does 'solely' automated mean?</h2>
				<p>Solely means a decision-making process that is totally automated and excludes any human influence on the outcome. A process
				might still be considered solely automated if a human inputs the data to be processed, and then the decision-making is carried
				out by an automated system.
				A process won’t be considered solely automated if someone weighs up and interprets the result of an automated decision before
				applying it to the individual.</p>

		<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>
			Automation is becoming a real thing in the world, with examples of automation in production. A growing field in automation is 
			automated decision making, decisions solely made by computers. Despite automated decision making sounds rather risky, 
			there is also a benefit to this. But also, there is ofcourse ethical and moral issues that concern this topic. Automated
			decision making is an example of machine learning, where the computer learns with the data that they are given.

		<h2>Profiling</h2>
			<p>
			Profiling analyses aspects of an individual’s personality, behaviour, interests and habits to make predictions or decisions about them.
			This can be linked to automated decision making as a computer can do this to help with making decisions. 
			<br><br>The GDPR(General Data Protection Regulation) defines profiling as:	
			<br>‘profiling’ means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal 
			aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work,
			economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.</p>
		<h2>Benefits</h2>
			<p>Profiling and automated decision making can be very useful for organisations and also benefit individuals in many sectors, including healthcare, education, 
			financial services and marketing. They can lead to quicker and more consistent decisions, particularly in cases where a very large volume of data needs to
			be analysed and decisions made very quickly.</p>
		<h2>Risks</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Profiling is often invisible to individuals.</li>
				<li>People might not expect their personal information to be used in this way.</li>
				<li>People might not understand how the process works or how it can affect them.</li>
				<li>The decisions taken may lead to significant adverse effects for some people.</li>
				<li>There could be a malfunciton in the decision making.</li>
				<li>The decisions made could be wrong.</li>
			</ul>
