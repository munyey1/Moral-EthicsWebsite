			<h2>Will Piracy ever die down?</h2>
				<p>Even though piracy is a crime, it will never die and it will surely increase as time goes on.
				This is due to the fact that technology is evolving and as the population increases, the want
				for certain software or content will rise, ultimately leading to piracy.
				</p>
				<p>This video demonstrates this.

			<h2>The Risks of Piracy</h2>
				<p>Nevertheless, the risks are always greater than the opportunities. The main opportunities are:
				<ul>
					<li><b>Piracy is illegal</b>: It is a federal crime to make, sell or download unlicensed material. Therefore, 
					people who are found guilty of the crime can be fined up to $250,000, and/or sentenced to up 5 
					years in prison.
					</li>
					<li><b>It is risky</b>: Pirated software does not always contain the content itself. There is a 
					huge chance that the pirated software is more likely to be infected with serious computer
					viruses, which can damage the user's computer system. Pirating isn't always safe, and the internet 
					will always be the internet, in a sense of that the internet is never safe.</li>
					<li><b>It is unproductive</b>: Some software will come with manuals and paper work to help the 
					user with the software and most pirated software does not come with manuals or technical 
					support that is given to legitimate users. Thus, pirates are less likely to derive as much 
					use out of software as users who have obtained the software through legal channels. In 
					addition, software becomes outdated rapidly pirated software is ineligible for upgrades.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>Although we understand that piracy is illegal and the risks are great, people still think 
				that piracy should be an option as it can help with popularity of the product. 
				<br>This video explains why piracy should be a choice.

			<h2 style='padding-top:20%'>The effects of the legislation</h2>
				<p>It is coherent that this legislation was placed, the ultimate goal of this is to protect the 
				people who are suffering from these acts or cyberbullying. With the evergrowing social media 
				population, it is likely that these types of communications are to happen so it benefits 
				hugely.

		<h1>Software Piracy</h1>
			<p>
			Software piracy is any attempt to break the licence terms of a piece of software. This includes downloading 
			and using a program without paying for it, as well as buying, selling or giving away illegitimate copies 
			of a game or any other piece of software. It could mean extracting code from a program, or modifying it 
			without permission in order to do something that the developers did not wish you to do. 
			</p>
		<h2 style ='padding-top:2%;'>The Moral Issues</h2>
			<p>
			It is ethically wrong to participate in piracy, as it significantly impacts the maker of the material 
			heavily. It is reduces their income greatly and is illegal. It is a federal crime to make unauthorised 
			copies of content and people who are found guilty of this crime can be fined up to $250,000, and/or 
			sentenced up to 5 years in prison. Despite this, people still engage in piracy, the main reason of 
			this is because the content is free! When people hear that games or software can be accessed for free 
			but all you have to do is a bit of tinkering, the outcome is positive. Therefore, piracy is a big issue 
			in the modern world.
			</p>
		<h2 style ='padding-top:2%;'>Opportunites of Piracy</h2>
			<p>There are certain advantages to pirating software. Main benefits include:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Cost</b>: pirated software costs nothing, or close to nothing, to obtain. With some consumer 
				software packages now costing upwards of $500, the amount of money saved by pirating software is 
				certainly not negligible.</li>
				<li><b>Easy to Acquire</b>: Pirated software is extremely easy to find, whether online, or sold 
				openly in foreign countries, or simply provided by friends. In fact, in many cases, it easier 
				for someone to go online and download an illegal copy of a software program than to drive to a 
				store and buy it from a retailer.</li>
				<li><b>Anonymity</b>: Pirating software is a crime that can be committed without leaving one's 
				house, or even interacting with any person. Thus, it is very tempting to commit this 
				"victimless" crime.</li>
				<li><b>Profit</b>: Although most software pirates do not profit directly from pirating software,
				the temptation to make money by selling illegal programs is strong. All one needs to become 
				a software pirate is a CD burner, which now cost as little as $100, and the pirate's computer 
				can become a virtual cash cow.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
		<h1>What can we do against piracy?</h1>
			<p>There are many things that we can do against piracy, this can include:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Don't buy unlicensed copies</b>: Buy software from an authorized dealer and don't use any 
				program that is cleary unauthorised. When purchasing software, be sure to get the genuine product,
				manuals, and license documentation. Do some research on the price you can expect to get.
				If the product is distincly cheaper than the original then it is most likely pirated.
				It is also important to carefully read the license agreement that comes with the 
				software, since license agreements differ from publisher to publisher. Don't buy software 
				labeled 'Not for Resale.' Never purchase software labeled 'For Bundles Only' or 
				'OEM Distribution' without the appropriate hardware.</li>
				<li><b>Keep everything that comes with the product</b>: Keep the original receipt and 
				invoice of the product, which are the proof that you have purchased legal software. 
				Furthermore, always register your product so you can get all the technical support 
				and possible upgrade you might need in the future.</li>
				<li><b>Don't participate in any pirating</b> Don't make copies unless it is 
				allowed by the license agreement. Don't rent, lease, sublicense or lend the software or 
				documentation to anyone. Don't download illegal software from warez sites or ftp servers.</li>
				<li><b>Spread awareness</b>: When you find out a friend or someone might be taking part in 
				pirating, you should make them aware of the risks and that what they are doing is very 
				illegal.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
		<h1>Offensive Communications</h1>
		<h2>The Problem</h2>
			<p>The rise of the internet and social media in recent decades has fundamentally reshaped the 
			way we engage with each other and as a society. This radical shift has brought many benefits,
			but there are also associated risks and harms, and it has proved challenging for the law to 
			keep pace with this rapidly changing environment.
			</p>
		<h2>Malicious Communications Act 1988</h2>
			<p>Offensive communications can be linked to the Malicious Communications Act 1988, where the act 
			protects individuals who are experiencing any offensive/malicious communications through 
			electronic devices.
			</p>
			<p>It states:
			<br>
			(a)a letter, electronic communication or article of any description which conveysâ€”
				(i)a message which is indecent or grossly offensive;
				(ii)a threat; or
				(iii)information which is false and known or believed to be false by the sender; or
			(b)any article or electronic communication which is, in whole or part, of an indecent or 
			grossly offensive nature,is guilty of an offence if his purpose, or one of his purposes, 
			in sending it is that it should, so far as falling within paragraph (a) or (b) above, cause 
			distress or anxiety to the recipient or to any other person to whom he intends that it or its 
			contents or nature should be communicated.
			</p>

		<h2>What can we do against offensive communications?</h2>
			<p>The best thing that we can do is to tell someone about any offensive communications that we experience.
			If you know is suffering against any offensive communications then you should tell them about the Malicious 
			Communications Act 1988. To add to this, that person can report this communication to higher authorities,
			like the police, and then they can handle the rest.
