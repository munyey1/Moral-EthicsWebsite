			<h2>Cambridge Analytica</h2>
				<iframe width="800" height="520" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VDR8qGmyEQg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<p>This video here presents a prime example of how a company can use personal information of individuals,
				and how it can greatly effect many in the world. The data Cambridge Analytica had was from Facebook and 
				it was used to almost manipulate people with their decisions in the 2016 USA presidential election. 
				They did this by targeting voter groups, eg. conservative or liberal. This was only disclosed to the public
				in early 2018 and to add to this, executives of Cambridge Analytica said that they were working in more than 200 
				elections around the world, including Trinidad and Tobago, Nigeria, the Czech Republic, and Argentina. This 
				is quite clearly a vioaltion of privacy and the use of personal data collected without knowledge or permission 
				to establish sophisticated models of user's personalities raises ethical and privacy issues.

		<h1>Personal Data</h1>
		<p>
			The analysis of personal data has become a massive field in recent years. There have been a rise in 'big data' 
			companies which specialise in performing large scale analysis on bulk data which is collected from various 
			sources. To imagine the scale of the data about you, you must consider the sources from which is originates. 
			Every like on social media, every check in on your phone, location data collected by your phones, every web 
			search, every page you access and more. This only scratches the surface of the sources. There was a huge scandal 
			of this back in 2018 where the company, 'Cambridge Analytica' used a plethora of personal information to skew 
			peoples decisions in the 2016 presidential election.
			</p>
		<h2 style ='padding-top:2%;'>Our Privacy</h2>
			<p>
			Data has become a serious commodity which means that it is often sold between companies in order to make a 
			profit. You can tend to see this happen when you suddenly get emails and communications from companies that 
			you have never registered with. Selling data about people clearly shows that data is highly sought after, 
			which raises the question about how reliant the future of technology will be on data. However, it is also used 
			for good within governments to analyse crime hot spots and determine how best to protect citizens, but this 
			doesn't resolve everything.

		<h1>Moral issues of Analysis of Personal Information</h1>
			<p>When collecting data from individuals, clarification of this must be clear, otherwise, it is morally 
			and ethically wrong to secretly gather information about people without telling them. With this being said, 
			companies and businesses will still strive to collect data about people and it is only a matter of time whenever 
			another scandal like Cambridge Analytica will happen. 
			</p>
			<p>
			This video is an example of how companies will collect and gather information and data about people. 
			In this example, it is about Facebooks data breach.
