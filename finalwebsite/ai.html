		<h1>Interesting Facts</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>AI is Estimated to Kill 6% of Jobs by 2021.</li>
				<li>Most AI Bots Are Female.</li>
				<li>predicted that the global GDP will grow by $15.7 trillion by 2030 because of AI.</li>
				<li>Already 77% of the devices we use feature one form of AI or another.</li>
			</ul>
		<h1 style='padding-top:15%'>A few examples of Artficial Intelligence</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Commercial flights use an AI autopilot.</li>
				<li>Siri - the personal assistant.</li>
				<li>Tesla's self-driving feature</li>
				<li>Alexa - smart home hub</li>
				<li>Manufacturing robots</li>
				<li>Amazons recommendation system</li>
			</ul>
		<h1 style='padding-top:15%'>Risks</h1>
			<h2>Job Automation</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Job automation is generally considered as the most immediate concern. With ai growing 
					rapidly, it's no longer a matter of if AI will replace certain types of jobs, but to what 
					degree.</li>
				</ul>
			<h2>Creation of Autonomous Weapons</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>It should be expected that this would be a risk, as many countries could apply AI 
					to their weapons for military defence.</li>
				</ul>
			<h2>Social Manipulation</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Social media through its autonomous-powered algorithms is very effective at target
					marketing. They know who we are, what we like and are incredibly good at surmising 
					what we think.</li>
				</ul>
				<br>A strong example of this would be Cambridge Analytica back in early 2018, where Cambridge 
				Analytica persuaded multiple people to vote for different parties in the election.
			<h2>Invasion of Privacy</h2>
				<ul>
				<li>It is now possible to track and analyze an individual's every move online as well as 
					when they are going about their daily business. Cameras are nearly everywhere, 
					and facial recognition algorithms know who you are. </li>
				</ul>

		<h1>What is AI?</h1>
			<p>
			AI(artificial intelligence) is the development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring the intelligence 
			of a human, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision making, and the translation of languages.

		<h1>Benefits of AI</h1>
		<h2>24/7 Availability</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Machines don’t require frequent breaks and refreshments as like human beings.</li>
				<li>That can be programmed to work for long hours and can able to perform the job
				continuously without getting bored or distracted or even tired.</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Day to day assistance</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>AI like Siri or Alexa can provide help and assistance on a day to day basis. This 
				can include, asking what the weather is tomorrow or what are the steps to make a cake.</li>
				<li>Tesla cars have self driving, which in certain circumstances can help a lot.</li>
				<li>Handling repetitive jobs - Repeated jobs are tedious in nature. That kind of jobs 
				can be easily handled with the help of AI algorithms. These kinds of job don’t require
				much intelligence in between the process.</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Faster Decisions</h2>
			<ul> 
				<li>Using artificial intelligence alongside cognitive technologies can help make faster
				decisions and carry out actions quicker.</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Avoiding Errors</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The phrase “human error” was born because humans, naturally, make mistakes from time 
				to time. Computers however, do not make these mistakes – that is, of course, assuming
				they are programmed properly. With artificial intelligence, data could be processed
				error-free, no matter how big the dataset might be</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Taking risks on behalf of humans</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>With artificial intelligence, you can arguably lessen the risks you expose humans 
				to in the name of research. Take, for example, space exploration and the Mars rover,
				known as Curiosity. It can travel across the landscape of Mars, exploring it and 
				determining the best paths to take, while learning to think for itself. Using artificial 
				intelligence in this manner could potentially lead to massive benefits in areas such 
				as demand forecasting, medical diagnosis and oil exploration.</li>

		<h1>The Future of AI</h1>
		<p>AI is empowering the ability for autonomous operation of all types. Of course, the 
		first thing that comes to mind is autonomous vehicles, but this is just one specific 
		application of autonomous systems. In the future, all modes of transportation will 
		become autonomous, and this will bring about a change in the way we think of things like vehicles.
		</p>
		<p>The combination of computer vision, machine learning, natural language processing, predictive
		analytics, and the world of intelligent sensors and devices means that we will be awash in 
		autonomous systems of all sorts pervasive in our daily lives.
		</p>
		<p>We will come to use and sometimes rely on AI systems to enhance our daily interactions 
		with each other, expand our creativity, and give us ways to express ourselves that we 
		can’t otherwise do today. In the same way that spell check is part of the daily world of 
		even the most casual of writers, AI will be used to give us powers of language translation 
		and augmented creativity. Already, AI systems are helping those with limited artistic talents 
		compose and produce original and powerful works of art and music.
		</p>
		<p>We don't really know how soon or in what ways these visions of the AI-enabled future 
		will become a reality, but even the most casual of observers can see that these are 
		inevitable trends. The one thing that is certain is that it’s coming and we’re already 
		heading in that direction. Companies are developing and investing in these technologies 
		now. The future is AI enabled and it’s up to us to figure out what that means for our daily lives.
		</p>
		<p>Here is a video predicting what will come in the future.
